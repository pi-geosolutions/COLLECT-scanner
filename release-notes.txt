1.1.1
-----
- inserts or updates have been made transactional ("all or nothing").
- added a "softUpdate" feature : not recommended but sometimes handy. Should follow update 
file naming convention + end by softUpdate.csv to be activated
- file not published error message is more explicit and verbose
- write a "light log" in each scanned directory (where files have been processed)
in order to give the end user a clue wheter or not it failed and why

1.1.0
-----
- UPSERT functionality has been updated. It now uses postgresql 9.5+ UPSERT feature 
(INSERT ... ON CONFLICT UPDATE) and is now, thus, only available when using 
postgresql 9.5+ (if using older postgresql BD or other DB, you should unactivate updates) 

1.0.1
-----
- Supports null values
- trims whitespaces around values

1.0.0
-----
First stable release.
